# Euler's Method for Solving Differential Equations

Euler's Method is a simple and straightforward numerical technique used to solve first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This method is particularly useful for obtaining an approximate solution when an exact analytical solution is difficult or impossible to find.

## Overview of Euler's Method

Euler's Method is based on the idea of using the tangent line at a known point to estimate the value of the function at the next point. It uses the following iterative formula:

\[ y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n) \]

where:
- \( y_{n+1} \) is the estimated value of the function at \( x_{n+1} \).
- \( y_n \) is the known value of the function at \( x_n \).
- \( h \) is the step size.
- \( f(x_n, y_n) \) is the value of the derivative at \( (x_n, y_n) \).
