# Solving Differential Equations

In this section, I will describe methods for solving differential equations, specifically focusing on Simpson's One-Third Rule and the Runge-Kutta Methods (Second Order and Fourth Order).

## What is a Differential Equation?

A differential equation is an equation that relates a function with its derivatives. Differential equations describe various phenomena such as heat, motion, electricity, and fluid flow. The solution to a differential equation is a function that satisfies the equation.

### Example

Consider the first-order differential equation:

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = x + y \]

To solve this equation, we need to find the function \( y(x) \) that satisfies this relationship.
