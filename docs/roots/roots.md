# Root Finding Methods

On this section, I will briefly describe finding the root of an equation using the Bisection Method and Newton-Raphson Method.

## What is the Root of an Equation?

The root of an equation is a value that satisfies the equation, meaning that when the root is substituted into the equation, it results in a true statement (usually equating to zero). In other words, the root is the value of the variable that makes the equation equal to zero.

### Example

Consider the quadratic equation:

\[ f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \]

To find the roots of this equation, we solve for \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \). 

The equation can be factored as:

\[ (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 \]

From this factorization, we can see that the roots of the equation are:

\[ x = 1 \] and \[ x = 3 \]

These are the values that satisfy the equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).

Next, we will delve into two numerical methods to find roots of equations: the Bisection Method and the Newton-Raphson Method.
